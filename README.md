### Problem Statement

In the crowded social media space, local initiatives often struggle for visibility, limiting the impact of social welfare efforts.

### Solution

Aid-Employ provides a dedicated platform using AI to connect users with relevant drives in their area.

### Impact

The platform centralizes information, connecting helping minds within specific areas. Initial goals include empowering users to post and discover drives seamlessely.

![8b824041-82c0-4d61-9aee-5cdc44270a4d](https://github.com/AKACHI-4/Aid-Employ/assets/99159580/4c4ee604-0c73-42db-b0ef-5ceaffdc592b)

### Architecture

Architecture mirrors social media platform, with users and communities posting social drives. Backend processes and Gemini-Pro chat model assist in getting users drives data efficiently.

### Technology Stack

- Frontend: Flutter, Routemaster, Riverpod 2.0,
- Backend: Firebase (Auth, Storage , Firestore)
- AI Model: Gemini-Pro Chat
- Chatbot: Telegram, Google Compute Engine

### Challenges
The primary challenge was with Gemini-Pro's unavailability for fine-tuning. The team considers move ahead with a python script based telegram chatbot.
Multimodal Tasks with the Gemini API [firestore-multimodal-genai@0.0.8] Extension for the filtering and tagging of posts .

### Future Steps
**Under Development**
-  Integrating Google Maps to platform so that users can perform food/Cloth/toy deliver volunteering while going on evening walk. (resources available for charity can be posted in platform with pickup location).

**Potential Scaling**
The team envisions direct government involvement, allowing efficient management of government-owned and local social welfare programs. 
Integration of AI models for program verification is a potential future enhancement.

### Scaling

To scale further, we are planning to keep the user interface minimal, implement automation for faster build and release, and ensure accessibility across devices (cross-origin support).
