## How to Get a Telegram Bot Token

1. Search for the "BotFather" on Telegram.
2. Start a chat and send `/newbot` to create a new bot.
3. Give your bot a name and username.
4. Once the bot is created, BotFather will give you a token. This token is used to authenticate and interact with the Telegram API.

Remember to use the Secrets pane to set the bot and try it out yourself.
